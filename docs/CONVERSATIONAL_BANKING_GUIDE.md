# Conversational Banking Guide

Learn how to interact with the AI banking assistant through natural conversations.

## Getting Started

Just send a message like you're texting a friend. The AI understands natural language and Nigerian expressions.

## Example Conversations

### Balance Check
```
You: "What's my balance?"
AI: "Your balance is ₦25,000. You're doing well! 📈"
```

### Money Transfer
```
You: "Send 5k to 1234567890 access bank"
AI: "💰 Transfer Confirmation

Send ₦5,000.00 to [Account Name]?
Type 'yes' to confirm or 'no' to cancel."

You: "yes"
AI: "✅ Transfer successful! Reference: TRF_xyz123"
```

### Transaction History
```
You: "How much did I spend this week?"
AI: "You've spent ₦15,000 this week: ₦10k transfers, ₦5k airtime."
```

## Amount Formats

All these work:
- `5k` → ₦5,000
- `5000` → ₦5,000
- `₦5,000` → ₦5,000
